# Credit Card Fraud Analysis
In this project we look at credit card transaction data. Firstly, we do an EDA to get familiar with the data, try to get some summary statistics. We try to get familiar with the fraudulent transactions, where & when do they occur the most often. We look at states and cities to see if there is some patter or trend. Furthermore, we try to create a profile of the users which have become victims of such fraud (age group, job, city/state). We also look at the $ amounts of fraudulent transactions and check their distribution across locations.

Ideally, we create a ML model which classifies whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
